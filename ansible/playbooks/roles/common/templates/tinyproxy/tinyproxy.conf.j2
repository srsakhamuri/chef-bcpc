# User/Group: This allows you to set the user and group that will be
# used for tinyproxy after the initial binding to the port has been done
# as the root user. Either the user or group name or the UID or GID
# number may be used.

# Port: Specify the port which tinyproxy will listen on.  Please note
# that should you choose to run on a port lower than 1024 you will need
# to start tinyproxy using root.

Port {{ local_proxy['config']['port'] }}


# Listen: If you have multiple interfaces this allows you to bind to
# only one. If this is commented out, tinyproxy will bind to all
# interfaces present.

Listen {{ local_proxy['config']['listen'] }}


# Timeout: The maximum number of seconds of inactivity a connection is
# allowed to have before it is closed by tinyproxy.

Timeout 600

# DefaultErrorFile: The HTML file that gets sent if there is no
# HTML file defined with an ErrorFile keyword for the HTTP error
# that has occured.

DefaultErrorFile "/usr/share/tinyproxy/default.html"


# StatFile: The HTML file that gets sent when a request is made
# for the stathost.  If this file doesn't exist a basic page is
# hardcoded in tinyproxy.

StatFile "/usr/share/tinyproxy/stats.html"


# Logfile: Allows you to specify the location where information should
# be logged to.  If you would prefer to log to syslog, then disable this
# and enable the Syslog directive.  These directives are mutually
# exclusive.

# LogLevel:
#
# Set the logging level. Allowed settings are:
#   Critical    (least verbose)
#   Error
#   Warning
#   Notice
#   Connect     (to log connections without Info's noise)
#   Info        (most verbose)
#
# The LogLevel logs from the set level and above. For example, if the
# LogLevel was set to Warning, then all log messages from Warning to
# Critical would be output, but Notice and below would be suppressed.

# PidFile: Write the PID of the main tinyproxy thread to this file so it

# Upstream:
#
# Turns on upstream proxy support.
#
# The upstream rules allow you to selectively route upstream connections
# based on the host/domain of the site being accessed.
#
# For example:
#  # connection to test domain goes through testproxy
#  upstream testproxy:8008 ".test.domain.invalid"
#  upstream testproxy:8008 ".our_testbed.example.com"
#  upstream testproxy:8008 "192.168.128.0/255.255.254.0"
#
#  # no upstream proxy for internal websites and unqualified hosts
#  no upstream ".internal.example.com"
#  no upstream "www.example.com"
#  no upstream "10.0.0.0/8"
#  no upstream "192.168.0.0/255.255.254.0"
#  no upstream "."
#
#  # connection to these boxes go through their DMZ firewalls
#  upstream cust1_firewall:8008 "testbed_for_cust1"
#  upstream cust2_firewall:8008 "testbed_for_cust2"
#
#  # default upstream is internet firewall
#  upstream firewall.internal.example.com:80
#
# The LAST matching rule wins the route decision.  As you can see, you
# can use a host, or a domain:
#  name     matches host exactly
#  .name    matches any host in domain "name"
#  .        matches any host with no domain (in 'empty' domain)
#  IP/bits  matches network/mask
#  IP/mask  matches network/mask

no upstream "{{ cloud_fqdn }}"

# MaxClients: This is the absolute highest number of threads which will
# be created. In other words, only MaxClients number of clients can be
# connected at the same time.

MaxClients 100


# MinSpareServers/MaxSpareServers: These settings set the upper and
# lower limit for the number of spare servers which should be available.
#
# If the number of spare servers falls below MinSpareServers then new
# server processes will be spawned.  If the number of servers exceeds
# MaxSpareServers then the extras will be killed off.

MinSpareServers 5
MaxSpareServers 20


# StartServers: The number of servers to start initially.

StartServers 10


# MaxRequestsPerChild: The number of connections a thread will handle
# before it is killed. In practise this should be set to 0, which
# disables thread reaping. If you do notice problems with memory
# leakage, then set this to something like 10000.

MaxRequestsPerChild 0


# Allow: Customization of authorization controls. If there are any
# access control keywords then the default action is to DENY. Otherwise,
# the default action is ALLOW.
#
# The order of the controls are important. All incoming connections are
# tested against the controls based on order.

Allow 127.0.0.1


# ViaProxyName: The "Via" header is required by the HTTP RFC, but using
# the real host name is a security concern.  If the following directive
# is enabled, the string supplied will be used as the host name in the
# Via header; otherwise, the server's host name will be used.
#
ViaProxyName "tinyproxy"

# ConnectPort: This is a list of ports allowed by tinyproxy when the
# CONNECT method is used.  To disable the CONNECT method altogether, set
# the value to 0.  If no ConnectPort line is found, all ports are
# allowed (which is not very secure.)
#
# The following two ports are used by SSL.
